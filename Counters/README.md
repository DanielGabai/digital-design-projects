# 3-Bit Synchronous Counter

## Overview
This project implements a 3-bit synchronous binary counter using T Flip-Flops. The counter includes active-high `Reset` and active-high `Enable` inputs.

On each rising edge of the clock signal, if `Enable` is high (`1`), the counter increments by 1. If `Reset` is high (`1`), the counter resets to 0 immediately.

The counter outputs are displayed using a 3-bit output connected to a display.

|----------|------------------------------------------|
| CLK      | Clock signal                            |

## Outputs
| Name | Description               |
|------|---------------------------|
| Q0   | Least Significant Bit (LSB) |
| Q1   | Middle bit                 |
| Q2   | Most Significant Bit (MSB) |

> Note: T Flip-Flops are used with AND gates for clock gating and enable logic. Output is displayed on a 3-bit display for easy visualization.

## Notes
This counter is a fundamental sequential logic circuit and forms the basis for more complex digital systems such as datapaths, CPUs, and FSM-controlled modules.
